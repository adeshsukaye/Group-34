            <p> There are quite a lot of stories we hear that inspire us to do more and be better. One such woman farmer, Savita Kumbhar’s tale, is worthy of such admiration. Despite the difficulties that life threw her way, she rose above them and reclaimed
                herself.
            </p>
            <p class="font1">The untimely demise of her husband left the family unable to sustain their livelihood of farming and manage household requirements. An immensely difficult task to move forward after such a personal loss, but Savita, her two young sons, and
                her mother-in-law decided to find a way to thrive. Farming is their primary family occupation and had been for a few generations but Savita lacked the exact knowledge and her sons were too young. Despite the odds stacked against her, Savita
                resolved to learn the trade and be the sole breadwinner for the family. </p>
            <p class="font1">“I was confused initially and had lots of questions but I had my two children, their education, their future, my mother-in-law and all their dreams in mind. The thought of fulfilling their dreams gave me the courage and determination to succeed
                in farming.”

            </p>
            <p class="font1">What followed was days and nights of toil. Savita attributes her success in farming to the support of her family, neighbours, fellow farmers of her village and today AgroStar. She went through a lot of hardships that are a part of being a
                farmer like heavy lifting, long hours in the field, working with different chemicals and working at night; but always mentions how the support from her family, village and farming community kept her moving forward. Her biggest source of
                motivation has been her sons. For ease of operations in the field, she knew a tractor would make a huge difference but learning one wasn’t that easy. It was her sons who kept her motivated and despite several practice attempts resulting
                in damaged crops, they kept encouraging her. And eventually, she learnt it. Farming has always been a community activity and not a task managed by one single person. Women are an equal part of the farming community and Savita’s story is
                just one to bring light to that truth. In fact, women end up managing the household chores, cooking, and all main farming activities sans being involved in the decision-making processes.
