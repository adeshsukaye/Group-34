            <h3 class="faq-title">1.What is digital farming?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">The term ‘digital farming’ refers to technologies and trends being used to change the way growers control their farm operations and analyze their yield performance. It covers a broad range of areas such as soil sensing, irrigation control,
                farm management, machinery, and crop lifecycle management. For instance, sensors are showing growers new insights into soil conditions, yield performance and crop health. And automation is making it easier to control crucial things like
                irrigation systems remotely from your phone.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">2.Which kinds of farmers will benefit most from digital farming?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">Digital farming gives farmers a better view and understanding of their soil, their crops, and their equipment.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">3.What are the basic components of digital farming?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">Digital farming can be broken up into three different areas: precision, decision, and cultivation. Precision uses GPS geo-location services and extensions to sense, identify, and act on predictive decision making. Decision uses quality information
                that is timely and within the decision loop. This uses advanced sensors, descriptive models, and predictive algorithms to provide insight to crops, equipment, and other challenges. And cultivation uses end-to-end, real-time, continuous
                decision processes, as mentioned above. It looks at planting and harvesting, currently through the observational power of the farmer itself. In the future, it will look at things through the digital ecosystem. All three of these work together
                to deliver real time insights to farmers about their crops, land, and equipment.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">4.How can digital farming help me increase my yields?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">Digital farming is all about giving farmers real-time insights into their farm so they can analyze and make optimal decisions for their farms. Using it can help farmers optimize irrigation systems and strategies, weather data, soil and plant
                data, and more.</p>

            <p class="faq-text">According to the Dictionary definition, “Farming is the act or process of working the ground, planting seeds, and growing edible plants. You can also describe raising animals for milk or meat as farming… Farming is a great way to describe
                the lifestyle and work of people whose jobs are in the agriculture industry.” The noun “farm,” which derives from the Medieval Latin Firma, originally meant, “A lease on farm land.” </p>
