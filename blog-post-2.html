            <p> How many delivery boys do you encounter in your day to day life?
            </p>
            <p class="font1">Let me tell you about mine as of yesterday – Amazon delivered a parcel for me in the morning, then in the afternoon Swiggy delivered my lunch. In the evening I reached home to receive grocery from BigBasket and finally, Zomato delivered my
                dinner. Our lives have been so simplified by the advent of technology and it has become so easy to get things at your doorstep. </p>
            <p class="font1">“Now, imagine a village some 50 km away from the city center. A farmer wants to buy seeds for his farm and a few crop solutions that are needed to nourish and protect his existing crop. He may get only a few of these supplies in his village
                and for the rest, he has to do a 100 km round trip.”

            </p>
            <p class="font1">This is the reality for millions of farmers across agrarian India. While it is not easy being a farmer anywhere in the world, but in India, it is particularly difficult due to the slow pace of tech reaching the rural areas, lack of awareness
                about good farming practices, adulteration of medicines and many more grave reasons. This is where AgroStar has been playing a crucial role in changing the landscape of agriculture by being one of the key pioneers of AgriTech in India
                since 2014. Today, we have solved the key problems of farmers that of inaccessibility of good quality agri inputs that are required for their farms. How?

            </p>
            <p class="font1">We created an Ecosystem that enables the procurement of quality and in-demand inputs from the most reputed agri brands across the country. We then made it available to farmers on our platform, through our unique missed call based system and
                our free app on the Playstore. Today, our platform ensures that farmers get the necessary agri inputs at their doorstep, with ease and when they need it. What channel did we use?

            </p>
            <p class="font1">Well, going with the brick and mortar model was definitely not feasible with the limited reach, a high cost attached and farmers would still have to travel to reach the store. We thought of the channel which had maximum reach in Indian villages
                – India Post.

            </p>
            <p class="font1">India Post today has the maximum reach as the last mile channel in India. They cover even the remotest of the villages and so they were the ideal partners to support our reach and doorstep delivery solution.
