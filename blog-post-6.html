            <p> Agriculture in India is livelihood for a majority of the population and can never be underestimated.
            </p>
            <p class="font1">Although its contribution in the gross domestic product (GDP) has reduced to less than 20 per cent and contribution of other sectors increased at a faster rate, agricultural production has grown. This has made us self-sufficient and taken
                us from being a begging bowl for food after independence to a net exporter of agriculture and allied products.
            </p>
            <p class="font1">Total foodgrain production in the country is estimated to be a record 291.95 million tonnes, according to the second advance estimates for 2019-20. This is news to be happy about but as per the estimates of Indian Council for Agricultural
                Research (ICAR), demand for foodgrain would increase to 345 million tonnes by 2030.

            </p>
            <p class="font1">Increasing population, increasing average income and globalisation effects in India will increase demand for quantity, quality and nutritious food, and variety of food. Therefore, pressure on decreasing available cultivable land to produce
                more quantity, variety and quality of food will keep on increasing.
            </p>
            <p class="font1">India is blessed with large arable land with 15 agro-climatic zones as defined by ICAR, having almost all types of weather conditions, soil types and capable of growing a variety of crops. India is the top producer of milk, spices, pulses,
                tea, cashew and jute, and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane and cotton.

            </p>
            <p class="font1">In spite of all these facts, the average productivity of many crops in India is quite low. The countryâ€™s population in the next decade is expected to become the largest in the world and providing food for them will be a very prime issue. Farmers
                are still not able to earn respectable earnings.

            </p>
            <p class="font1">Future of agriculture is a very important question for the planners and all other stakeholders. Government and other organisations are trying to address the key challenges of agriculture in India, including small holdings of farmers, primary
                and secondary processing, supply chain, infrastructure supporting the efficient use of resources and marketing, reducing intermediaries in the market. There is a need for work on cost-effective technologies with environmental protection
                and on conserving our natural resources.
            </p>
            <p class="font1">The reforms towards privatisation, liberalisation and globalisation affected inputs market at a faster pace. Agricultural marketing reforms after 2003 made changes in marketing of agricultural outputs by permitting private investment in developing
                markets, contract farming and futures trading, etc. These amendments in marketing acts have brought about some changes but the rate is less.
